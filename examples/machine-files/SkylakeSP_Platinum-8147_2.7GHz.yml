# This machine file is for 2.7 GHz, like on supermuc! When using for another Skylake 8174 machine,
# take care to review the clock.
# FIXME
# FIXME 16B/cy bidirectional transfers between L2 and L3 are not (yet) supported by kerncraft
# FIXME performance counters might be wrong. This will only affect the Benchmark model
# FIXME bandwidth measurements need validataion
